# The Learning Roadmap

This is where we will be planning out our journey of learning about AI. Now, this is just to give you an idea on how this hsould look like, but ultimately it is up to YOU to decide how you want to learn and in what direction you want to go. There are core fundamentals that everyone should know, but after learning them, AI branches off into different subcategories and specializations that require an extensive amount of additional learning. Now, don't get discouraged. Learning AI is a life long process and it never stops.
